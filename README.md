# A-scratch-DJ-training-and-evaluation-tool
Time series data classification is applied to various scenarios such as stock prediction, speech recognition, signature recognition, etc. This method is also used more and more in the field of music. This project presents the process of time-series data classification on DJ scratching data. We propose a dynamic time-wrapping(DTW) and K-nearest-neighbour(KNN) classification algorithm to process DJ scratching data. We demonstrate the classification algorithm and get the accuracy on both professional and novice scratches.
